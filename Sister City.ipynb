    "\n",
    "Criteria for “sister’ city:\n",
    "Countries to consider are Germany, France, Italy, Spain. The city of choice must be similar to my home city in Outdoors & Recreation facilities/landmarks offered. Also, the city has to be big enough (population over 400000). The plan is to live in central area of the city and only facilities/landmarks located near the city center need to be considered. \n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. List of European cities with population statistics published on  http://worldpopulationreview.com/continents/cities-in-europe/ will be used to find prospect cities. \n",
